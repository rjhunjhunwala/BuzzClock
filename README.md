# BuzzClock

When running, or doing anything  it's often annoying to either carry around a phone and check it, or even glance down at a watch. Instead, this application, will buzz a number of times, in order to provide constant updates in terms of pace.

The buzzing will be in (up to) three groups... this will encode a base 5 number

Each group consists of n contained on  [0,4] pulses each one second long... and a triple buzz each .5 seconds long will announce the exact minute...
